# Robot Navigagtion with DRL

### Comparative Evaluation of DRL Methodologies in Environments with Multiple Dynamic Objects of High Dynamic Complexity

## **1. Backgrounds and Purposes**

* As the importance of autonomous robots grows, there is a demand for safe and reliable path planning in complex environments.
* Existing navigation algorithms have limitations in handling environmental changes and interacting with pedestrians.
* Utilizing the latest deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to improve safety and success rates compared to existing methods.
* Validating model performance in simulations with realistic scenarios using datasets incorporating social interactions.
